          The scientific name for the Kiwi bird is an Apteryx. Flypteryx is a 
          portmanteau of Flying Apteryx. I spent 15 years flying helicopters 
          and my callsign was Kiwi, hence Flying Apteryx or Flypteryx!

          I am a learning developer that needed a place to post projects.
